StdComparison
=============
A simple class implemented twice. Once with C++98 and once with C++11.
The blog post http://kullgren.org/?p=345 explains the differences.

Compile with:
  make all
  
Run the test with:
  ./myTest
  
The unit tests uses googletest. The compiler used is clang, but it should be trivial to change to gcc in the makefile.
